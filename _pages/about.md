Thank you for visting my site!

I am an Associate Professor in School of IoT at Jiangnan University. Before join JNU, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at University of Waterloo. I obtained my PhD degree from Queensland University of Technology. 

I investigate topics in the fields of machine learning/deep learning and signal processing. I am particularly interested in speech/audio analysis, time series analysis, and environment/ecology/biology applications.
